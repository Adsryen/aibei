  "short_essay_en_text":"When someone looks into your eyes they should see something alive within you. Having a dream is like owning a lighthouse1 which directs you on your journey.\nAt every turn we come across its mystery. At each new level we become more of the person we were meant to become. In lonely times, when we pass through a storm of disappointment, we find our faith is unshaken, our strength still strong.\nBelieve in your faith. Set the vision before your eyes. Write down your most sincere dreams and when the opportunity comes, step into your dream. It may take one season or more, but the result is the same. Make big dreams and then go out and make them realities. The highest hopes of the dreamer are revealed with every step taken in their journey to the impossible. For a season we must protect the dream so that it can grow quietly on the inside. But if we tenderly care for our deepest expectations, slowly but surely the dream will become new life.\nDreaming is an act of faith. The light of your expectations will cast off the shadows of a disbelieving world. God has given us the dreamer as a gift to light an unbelieving world.\nFind your treasure within and cherish2 it. Tomorrow is waiting for you to take the first step.",

  "short_essay_zh_text":"别人看你的眼睛时,他应当体会到你内心的活力。怀揣梦想就像是拥有一座引领你前行的灯塔。\n每个转折关头,它给我们带来奇迹。每个新的起点,我们脱胎换骨,焕然一新。孤独中我们挺过失望的阴霾,发现我们的信念不曾动摇,我们的力量依然强大。\n秉持信念,期盼未来。许下你最真诚的梦想,一旦机会来临,就为之拼搏。也许要花一季甚或更多的时间,但结局不会改变。立大志,倾全力,成现实。前途未卜,唯有一步一个脚印,梦想者的至高希冀才会实现。我们必须珍存梦想,给它一季的保护,让它在内心悄然生发。然而我们还得温柔呵护我们内心至深的期许,慢慢地梦想必将成就新的生命。\n梦想是实现信仰的第一步。你的期待熠熠光辉,它会驱逐不信的阴影。上帝赋予我们梦想的天资,去点亮不曾确信的世界。让梦想的财富寄于心中,珍爱它,明天正等着你跨出第一步。"},

  "short_essay_en_text":"Before the Rio Olympic Games came, the media reported some players that caught people’s attention. There is no doubt that these players have beautiful faces, which helps them win the attention. But the more important thing is that they are not only talented, but also work very hard. The chance to take part in the Olympic Games means the players are excellent and they have stood out in their countries.\nIf they win the golden medal in the Olympic Games, they will gain great fame and money around the world. The beautiful face brings players the market potential, which means they will be famous easily, but on the condition that they are the top players. Mariah Sharapova is the best example. She is beautiful and top tennis player all the time. So ability decides our position on the society.",

  "short_essay_zh_text":"里约奥运会到来之前，媒体报道了一些吸引人们注意力的球员。毫无疑问，这些球员拥有美丽的面孔帮他们赢得关注，但更重要的是，他们不仅才华横溢，而且训练非常勤奋。有机会参加奥运会的球员都是非常优秀的，意味着在自己的国家是脱颖而出的。\n如果他们在奥运会赢得金奖，他们将获得巨大的名声和金钱。漂亮的脸蛋可以给球员带来市场潜力，这意味着他们会比较容易出名，但前提条件是他们得是顶级球员。玛丽亚·莎拉波娃就是最好的例子，她长得漂亮，也是顶级的网球运动员。所以，能力决定着我们的社会地位。"},

  "short_essay_en_text":"\nEvery day of your life, it is important to take the time to “smell the roses” — to appreciate the experiences that lead to happiness. This is part of being truly happy.\nHappiness is a state of mind. It starts with accepting where you are, knowing where you are going and planning to enjoy every moment along the way. You know how to be happy, and feel that you have enough time or money or love or whatever you need to achieve your goals. And just feeling that you have enough of everything means that you do indeed have enough.",

  "short_essay_en_text":"In the history, women used to be looked down upon by men, and they were identified to be the housewife. But today, women are independent and strong. They have their own ability to chase what they want. An interview about the suggestions that were given by the hollywood female stars. No matter which countries they were from, all of them were agreed that every girl should live for herself instead of other people’s expectation. \nSome girls are easily lost themselves when they see the commercial ads, then they try to be perfect to look like the models. Actually, they are losing their own individuality and become the ordinary one. Girls don’t have to change themselves to cater for other people, they are special and have their own feature. Just keep these features and make you different.",

  "short_essay_en_text":"Friends play an important part in our lives, and although we may take the friendship for granted, we often don't clearly understand how we make friends. While we get on well with a number of people, we are usually friends with only a very few, for example, the average among students is about 6 per person. In all the cases of friendly relationships, two people like one another and enjoy being together, but beyond that, the degree of intimacy between them and the reasons for their shared interest vary enormously. As we get to know people we take into account things like age, race, economic condition, social position, and intelligence. Although these factors are not of prime importance, it is more difficult to get on with people when there is a marked difference in age and background.",

  "short_essay_zh_text":"生活中，朋友扮演着一个极为重要的角色。然而，我们可能把友谊视为理所当然，却通常并不清楚朋友是怎么结识的。尽管我们与很多人都相处融洽，但真正成为朋友的却只有少数几个——比如，学生平均每人有6个朋友，其中两人志趣相投，相处甚好；除此之外，朋友间的亲密程度及志趣相投的原因大有不同。我们在彼此结识时，常会考虑对方的年龄，种族，经济条件，社会地位和聪明才智等。尽管这些因素并非特别重要，但当人们在年龄与背景方面存在太大差异时，往往很难相处。"},

  "short_essay_en_text":"It is good to love, because love is difficult. For one human being to love another human being: that is  perhaps the most difficult task that has been entrusted to us, the ultimate task, the final test and proof, the work for which all other work is merely preparation.\nThat is why young people, who are beginners in everything, are not yet capable of love: it is something they must learn. With their whole being, with all their forces, gathered around their solitary, anxious, upward-beating heart, they must learn to love, But learning time is always a long, secluded time ahead and far on into life, is solitude, a heightened and deepened kind of aloneness for the person who loves. loving does not at first mean merging, surrendering or uniting with another person; it is a high inducement for the individual to ripen, to become something in himself, to become world, to become world in himself for the sake of another person; it is a great, demanding claim on him, something that chooses him and calls him to vast distances.",

  "short_essay_zh_text":"爱，很好。但爱是艰难的，因为我们去爱别人：这也许是神给予我们的最艰难、最重大的任务，是最后的考验与测试，是最崇高的工作、别的工作都不过是为此而做的准备。\n所以，那些一切都还刚刚开始的青年们还不能去爱，他们必须要学习。必须用他们整个的生命、用一切的力量，用集聚了他们寂寞、痛苦和荣誉感的心去学习爱。在学习时期这个长久而专注的过程中，爱就会永远地铭刻心扉——深深的寂寞中孤独地等待，是为了所爱的人。爱的要义并不是什么倾心、献身、或二人的结合。它对于个人是一种崇高的动力，是去成熟并实现自身的圆满，去完成一个世界，是为了另一个人而完成的世界，这是一个艰巨的、不可妥协的目标，用坚定的信念，向远方召唤。"}]
